# Ruby On Rails Web App - Event Booking System

## Project Delivery: Event Booking

Develop a web application that allows users and organizers to manage bookings for events. The application will need to implement the following features:

### Features for Organizers
- **User Registration:** Allow users to register on the platform.
- **Organizer Registration:** Allow organizers to register on the platform.
- **Event Creation:** Organizers can create events with specific details:
  - Name of the event
  - Start time and date
  - End time and date
  - Event location
  - Geographic position
  - Maximum number of participants

### Features for Users
- **Event Search:** Users can search for events, including filtering by geographic location.
- **Event Registration and Deregistration:** Users can sign up for or deregister from events.
- **Concurrent Event Restriction:** Prevent users from registering for events that overlap with other events they are already registered for.

### Administrative Features for Organizers
- **Participant Management:** Organizers can view the list of participants for their events and remove unwanted users.

### Notifications System
- **Variation Notifications:** Notify users registered for an event about any changes, cancellations by the organizer, or if they have been removed from the event.
- **Organizer Notifications:** Notify organizers about scenarios related to their events, such as reaching maximum capacity.
